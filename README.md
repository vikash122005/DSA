# 🔥 DSA Problems with Solutions – Concept by Concept!

Welcome to my DSA dojo! 🥋  
This is where I punch arrays, wrestle with linked lists, and high-kick recursion bugs into oblivion.

## 🧠 What's happening here?

Every day, I tackle DSA problems **concept-wise** like a gym workout for my brain 🏋️‍♂️.  
No skipping leg day, and definitely no skipping static arrays!

## 📅 Progress Log

- ✅ Static Array – kicked off with slicing, dicing, and inserting like a fruit ninja 🍉✂️  
- 🔜 Next up – Dynamic Arrays (where memory fears the resize) 😈  
- 💡 Goal – Become strong enough to make even Leetcode tremble 😤

## 🤪 Why am I doing this? 

Because future me wants to look back and say: 
_"I came, I saw, I debugged."_ 
Also, coffee only lasts so long ☕💻
